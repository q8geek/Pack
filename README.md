On 3/March/2021, I had a dream where I created this project. So it only makes sense to create it.

There's no real use for this project; it doesn't save space and there are far optimized, better, and superior packers and compressors to use instead of this. I only made this to get it out of my mind, literally.

Wrote this in Visual Studio 2019, so build and compile it there and it should work.
